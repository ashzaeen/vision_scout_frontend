# 🚀 VisionScout Frontend  

Frontend interface for **VisionScout** — an AI-powered assistant that analyzes real-world video input (from wearable glasses or camera uploads) to assess the condition and value of **cars** or **properties**.  

This repository contains the **React + Vite frontend**, responsible for:  
- Displaying the **landing page**, which explains our project in detail with a **clean, interactive UI**  
- Building a **listings page** with a **search bar**, a **mode toggle (Property / Cars)**, and **sleek cards** featuring popups for more detailed insights  
- Presenting a **chatbot interface** for viewing confidence reports (detected using **Vision Smart Glasses** or fetched from connected APIs)  
- Providing a **unified dashboard** for both **Car Mode** and **Property Mode**
