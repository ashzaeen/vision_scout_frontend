# 🚀 VisionScout Frontend

- Displaying live or recorded analysis results from the backend (YOLO / AI Detection Server)  
- Managing user interactions and video/image uploads  
- Rendering summarized detection insights and confidence scores  
- Providing a clean dashboard for both **Car Mode** and **Property Mode**
